### A Graphical Calculus of Substitutions

A review on the relationship between functions and substitutions  ... why this is important ... an indication of why this is subtle 

Would the students find examples from programming helpful (only simple things about variables and calling functions, no recursion)?

If yes, I could launch into the definition of a category from there ... lots of examples (10 min) 

and then go to monoidal categories ... this is not as terrible as it sounds, on the contrary, it makes categories more meaningful and may give students a better grip (10min)

In particular, there is a beautiful graphical calculus for monoidal categories that makes things quite intuitive and natural (10min)

Functions as an example of monoidal categories (10min)

The problem with substitution (10min) ... now this is going to be subtle ... I need to think about how to do this ...

Then we can think about how to extend monoidal categories to substitutions. Now here I can start to not explain everything in detail as the big ideas have been presented and I only need to convince the students that these ideas can be used to solve our problem. (10min)
