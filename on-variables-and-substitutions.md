## On Variables and Substitution

(under construction)

### Abstract

Variables---and operations of substituting values for variables---play an important role in mathematics and computer science. Whenever we want to design programming languages or build tools such as compilers, a careful understanding of variables is necessary. The difficulties and subtleties that arise in a study of variables link up with two of the most beautiful mathematical theories that are currently under intense development, the theory of nominal sets and the theory of string diagrams, both of which are children of category theory. In this talk, I will give an overview of the area and briefly touch on some ongoing collaboration with Samuel Balco. 

I hope that the presentation would appeal in equal measure to students of mathematics and of computer science.

### Functions and Substitutions

I try to make the talk interesting for students of maths and of computer science. So let us start with a dictionary.

set theory | type theory | category theory
-----------|-------------|----------------
set | data type | object  
function | program | arrow

### Categories 

### 2-Dimensional Algebra (aka monoidal categories)

### String Diagrammatic Calculi of 2-Dimensional Algebra

### A 2-Dimensional Calculus of Simultaneous Substitutions

### Summary and Outlook

We have learned quite a bit about category theory and string diagrams

A review on the relationship between functions and substitutions  ... why this is important ... an indication of why this is subtle 

Would the students find examples from programming helpful (only simple things about variables and calling functions, no recursion)?

If yes, I could launch into the definition of a category from there ... lots of examples (10 min) 

and then go to monoidal categories ... this is not as terrible as it sounds, on the contrary, it makes categories more meaningful and may give students a better grip (10min)

In particular, there is a beautiful graphical calculus for monoidal categories that makes things quite intuitive and natural (10min)

Functions as an example of monoidal categories (10min)

The problem with substitution (10min) ... now this is going to be subtle ... I need to think about how to do this ...

Then we can think about how to extend monoidal categories to substitutions. Now here I can start to not explain everything in detail as the big ideas have been presented and I only need to convince the students that these ideas can be used to solve our problem. (10min)
